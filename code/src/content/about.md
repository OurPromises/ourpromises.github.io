We are Amartya and Abhi, two teenagers in Northern Virginia with the vision of making a difference in communities around the world. We are both in 10th grade at high schools in Fairfax County, VA. We both are curious about the world around us and we love to explore new places. We also enjoy photography, travel, and playing video games in our free time; however, most of all we want to benefit people and make the world a better place.
