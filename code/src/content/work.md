Our first project was called Tender Years. Tender Years was a promotion done by Our Promises of the book Chhoti si Umar, written by the late Anshuman Dubey. Anshuman was a teenager who passed away from a terminal illness after writing the book. Anshuman’s story deeply resonated with us, and inspired us to found the Our Promises organization and create a website to promote Anshuman’s book.
